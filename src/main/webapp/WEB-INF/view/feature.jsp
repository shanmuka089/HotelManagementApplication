       <p>For swimming guests, water quality and hygiene are very important decision-making criteria when it comes to the use of a hotel swimming pool, 
           in addition to the design and features. Meanwhile, the hotel operator's considerations also focus on efficiency and reliability. 
           They ideally want to operate their pool fully automatically, and without significant staffing needs or specially trained personnel.</p>
        <p>Because energy costs play an important role in a pool, the use of renewable energy and the employment of energy-efficient systems 
            with intelligent control are particularly important. Ospa BlueControl is a control system that allows for numerous energy-saving 
            functions to be controlled, such as roll-top covers, water level lowering and speed-controlled pump operation.</p>
